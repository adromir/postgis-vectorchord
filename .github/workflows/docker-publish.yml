# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Adjust if your default branch is different (e.g., master)
  
  # Triggers the workflow on a schedule (runs daily at midnight UTC)
  # This will rebuild the image with the latest base image, effectively updating
  # your image if the base image has changed.
